# ZeppelinEmbed for Swift

`ZeppelinStore` is the async Swift actor over the frozen Zeppelin Embed C ABI.
The package targets macOS 14 or newer on Apple silicon and Intel. Release
consumers use the checksum-pinned XCFramework binary target in the root
`Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/zepdb/zeppelin-embed", from: "0.3.0")
```

Local source builds set `ZE_USE_LOCAL_FFI=1` after building the release FFI
archive. Release validation can set `ZE_USE_LOCAL_XCFRAMEWORK=1` to test the
artifact in `target/xcframework` before uploading it.

Store databases in Application Support. `OpenOptions.excludeFromBackup`
defaults to `true`, which applies `NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey` to the store
directory. Do not put a store in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or another synchronized
folder: the engine owns its rename, lock, and durability protocol.

The host owns maintenance scheduling. The package does not register or schedule
background work.
